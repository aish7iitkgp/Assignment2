# Assignment2
The goal of the project is to predict Leukemia cancer types among 72 cancer patients
**Assignment****
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which performs an in-depth data analysis followed by predictive modeling using three different algorithms.

**Content Overview**
**Importing Libraries**: Initial setup and importing necessary libraries.
**Data Import**: Loading the dataset for analysis.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Basic analysis of the dataset's characteristics.
**Training Data Preparation:** Preprocessing steps to prepare the training dataset.
**Testing Data Preparation**: Preprocessing steps to prepare the testing dataset.
**Visualizations on Training Data**: Visual analysis of the training dataset.
**Model Training and Analysis:**
  **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** Training and analysis of the SVM model.
  **Random Forest:** Training and analysis of the Random Forest model.
  **Neural Network Regression**: Training and analysis of the Neural Network model.
**Comparison of Models:** A comparative analysis of the three models: Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network.
